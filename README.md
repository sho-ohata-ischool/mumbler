# mumbler

Implementation of the mumbler program from the Scaling Up! Really Big Data class under the UC Berkeley Master of Information in Data Science program. 

Details of setting up the GPFS environment with three virtual servers can be seen [here](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/coursework/tree/master/week4/hw/gpfs_setup).

Execute the program by passing the starting word and the iteration amount, e.g. `python mumbler.py 'hello' 3`
